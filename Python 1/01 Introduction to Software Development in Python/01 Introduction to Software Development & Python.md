This chapter introduces foundational concepts about computers, programming languages, and Python itself. It’s mostly theoretical, but instructors can highlight key mental models and provide analogies to make abstract ideas stick.

## ✨ Chapter Summary

This chapter sets the stage for learning Python by exploring:

- What computers are and how software brings them to life
- The idea of programming languages and why they’re precise
- How code written in human-friendly languages becomes machine-friendly
- What PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals) are and how they shape the evolution of Python

Use this chapter to build curiosity and form mental models, not to drill syntax.

## 🖥️ 1. Computers and Software

### 🧑‍🏫 Instructor Notes:

- Emphasize the evolution from hardware-only machines to today's hardware-software combo.
    
- Encourage reflection: “What do you use computers for today?”
    
- Use personal analogies like: "The computer is like a kitchen, the hardware is your tools, and the software is your recipe."
    

### 📣 Japanese Phrases:

|Japanese|English|Romaji|
|---|---|---|
|コンピュータは何のために使いますか？|What do you use computers for?|konpyūta wa nan no tame ni tsukaimasu ka?|
|ハードウェアとソフトウェアの違いは何ですか？|What is the difference between hardware and software?|hādowea to sofutowea no chigai wa nan desu ka?|
|ソフトウェアは命令の集まりです。|Software is a collection of instructions.|sofutowea wa meirei no atsumari desu|

## 🧾 2. What is a Programming Language?

### 🧑‍🏫 Instructor Notes:

- Clarify that programming is **not** like natural language: computers need **exact syntax**.
    
- Use analogy: "Speaking to a computer is like talking to a very literal robot. Say one wrong word and it gets confused."
    
- Clarify that programming languages vary in how close they are to human thought (high-level) or machine thinking (low-level).
    

### 📣 Japanese Phrases:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Japanese|English|Romaji|
|プログラミング言語はコンピュータとの会話の方法です。|A programming language is how we talk to computers.|puroguramingu gengo wa konpyūta to no kaiwa no hōhō desu|
|高水準言語と低水準言語があります。|There are high-level and low-level languages.|kōsuijun gengo to teisūijun gengo ga arimasu|
|シンタックスは構文、セマンティックスは意味です。|Syntax is structure, semantics is meaning.|shintakkusu wa kōbun, semantikkusu wa imi desu|

## 💡 3. Computers and Code

### 🧑‍🏫 Instructor Notes:

- Stress that computers understand **binary**, not Python.
    
- Define interpreter vs compiler with real-world analogies:
    
    - **Compiler**: like translating a whole book before reading.
        
    - **Interpreter**: like a live translator at a conference.
        
- Note Python is interpreted → flexible but slower.
    

### 📣 Japanese Phrases:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Japanese|English|Romaji|
|コンピュータは0と1しかわかりません。|Computers only understand 0s and 1s.|konpyūta wa zero to ichi shika wakarimasen|
|インタプリタは一行ずつ翻訳します。|An interpreter translates line by line.|intapurita wa ichigyō zutsu hon'yaku shimasu|
|Pythonはインタプリタ型の言語です。|Python is an interpreted language.|Python wa intapurita-gata no gengo desu|

### 🧪 Optional Discussion Prompt:

- "Why might a company choose a compiled language over an interpreted one for a video game engine?"

## 📜 4. Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

### 🧑‍🏫 Instructor Notes:

- Compare to "law updates" or "official rulebooks".
    
- Mention PEP 8 briefly as the style guide.
    
- Reassure students: "You don’t need to memorize these, just know they exist."
    

### 📣 Japanese Phrases:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Japanese|English|Romaji|
|PEPはPython言語の改善案です。|PEPs are improvement proposals for Python.|PEP wa Python gengo no kaizen-an desu|
|PEP 8はスタイルガイドです。|PEP 8 is the style guide.|PEP 8 wa sutairu gaido desu|
|新しい機能はPEPで決まります。|New features are decided by PEPs.|atarashii kinō wa PEP de kimarimasu|

## 🔚 Summary for Instructors:

- Start light: this is about **framing the mindset** for learning.
    
- Keep explanations visual and analogy-based.
    
- Don’t stress memorization — this chapter is about **building mental models**.
    
- Use Japanese where it helps scaffold understanding, but don’t force it if students are already comfortable.
    
- Invite learners to ask: “Why does it work this way?”
