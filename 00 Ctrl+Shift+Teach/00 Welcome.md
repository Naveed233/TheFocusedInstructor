This is not your average teaching manual. This is an **open-source, ever-evolving guidebook**, built by instructors, for instructors — especially those of us who are comfortable with semicolons and curly braces, but slightly terrified of saying "変数のスコープ" out loud in front of a classroom.

It all started with one simple truth:

> “I know how to code. I just don’t know how to **explain it in Japanese**… to actual humans… with feelings.”

Whether you’re a super-skilled programmer who’s new to the classroom, a native Japanese speaker who wants to better support bilingual learners, or someone bravely teaching in your **second language** (and occasionally panicking mid-sentence), this guide is for **you**.

### What’s inside?

- ✅ Practical teaching tips
- ⚠️ Common student misunderstandings
- 🧪 Creative (and weirdly food-themed) examples
- 🈶 Japanese-English teaching phrases for technical terms
- 💬 Real notes and wisdom from real classrooms

It’s not a textbook. It’s a **teammate** — the kind that says:

> “Hey, I struggled with this too. Here’s how I survived.”

So whether you're explaining `for i in range()` or trying to figure out how to say “default parameter” without sweating, this guide has your back.

Let’s build something better, together.  
Let’s make Python less scary — and a lot more human.
