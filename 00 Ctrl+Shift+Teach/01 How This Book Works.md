This guidebook is organized by topic and designed to give fast teaching help, real examples, and explanations that are clear, simple, and beginner-friendly — even for students who feel tired or overwhelmed.

It is meant to support instructors who teach in bilingual environments (especially English ↔ Japanese), and help learners develop a strong foundation with confidence.

> “What does `print()` do, exactly? Does it send something to a printer? Does it store data? Why is it called ‘print’?”

This is a common question — and a reminder that even the simplest Python functions can feel confusing to beginners, especially in translation. This guide helps you explain clearly, in both English and Japanese, without stress.
