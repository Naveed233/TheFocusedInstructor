Here are a few battle-tested ideas we follow when teaching Python — especially to beginners, and especially when explaining in Japanese.

Whether you're teaching 10-year-olds or full-stack professionals, these habits make a big difference.

### 🧑‍🏫 Simplicity Wins

- 🕐 One idea per minute — not per paragraph  
- 🍙 Use real-world analogies (rice bowls, vending machines, Pokémon) instead of abstract logic

> 🧠 Example: "A variable is like a label on a lunchbox."

### 👋 Be Visual & Physical

- Use arrows on the whiteboard, draw boxes for memory
- Show loops with your **hand making a circle**
- Stand up and “walk through the code” like a character in it

### 🗣️ Speak Slowly + Repeat

- Keep Japanese instructions simple  
- Support spoken words with writing and gesture  
- Repeat keywords more than once — it helps **a lot**

### 💥 Normalize Mistakes

- Mistakes are learning moments — debug together  
- Show your own errors too (“Oops, forgot the colon!”)  
- Laugh with students when it breaks 🤖💥

> “Well, that crashed. Let’s find out why — together.”

### 🤪 Use Humor (Responsibly)

- Cats chasing lasers. Bath time loops. Ramen counters.  
- Funny examples = sticky concepts  
- Just enough to keep energy high (but not distracting)

### 🔁 Reinforce Often

- Learners need to hear things multiple times in different ways  
- Revisit old concepts briefly before introducing new ones  
- Check for understanding by asking students to explain it back

These aren’t strict rules — they’re practices that work **in the wild**, especially when explaining in a second language.

You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to be **clear**, **consistent**, and **human**.
